# Schnapsella

Schnapsella is a point-trick game for two players. It was invented by misinterpreting the rules of the classic Austrian game Schnapsen.

## The Cards

The game is played with a 20-card French- or German-suited deck. To play with a standard 52-card international deck, remove the cards from 2 to 9 inclusive.

The ranks and values of cards, from high to low, is as follows:

- Ace:  11
- Ten:  10
- King:  4
- Queen: 3
- Jack:  2

In the trump suit, the Jack becomes the highest ranked card while keeping its value of 2.

A pair of King and Queen in the trump suit held together in one player's hand is called a Bela. It is worth 20 card points and must be announced when playing the first card of the pair.

<!-- Note that declaring Bela is not mandatory. -->

## Dealing

Determine the first dealer by any acceptable means; thereafter, the player who wins a round deals the next. Each player receives 5 cards, dealt as one pack of 3 cards, then another pack of 2.

## Playing

Non-dealer leads the first trick, and subsequently the player who takes a trick leads the next. A trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump if any is played. Players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, he must play a trump card. If he cannot play trump either, he may play any suit. At the end of each trick, players replenish their hand to 5 cards by drawing from the talon.

At *any* time, either player may decide to announce the trump suit, irrespectively of the players' turns. Once the trump suit has been announced, players stop replenishing their hand and finish the round with their remaining cards.

<!-- If the trump suit is announced in between the replenishment of both players hand, the player who didn't replenish must do so before continuing to play. -->

## Scoring

The player who announced the trump suit counts the points in his tricks. A total of 66 card points is needed to win the round. Winning a round results in scoring 1 game point, while losing a round results in the opponent scoring 2 game points.

The overall winner is the first player that reaches 7 game points.
